# Fruit Detection with CNN

Welcome to the Fruit Detection project! üçéüççü•ù

## Overview

This project focuses on using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect and identify various fruits, including apples, pineapples, kiwis, blueberries, and oranges.

## Features

- **Fruit Detection:** The CNN accurately identifies different fruits in images.
- **Color-based Detection:** Implemented a dynamic detection system based on fruit color for enhanced accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Python
- tkinter

## Getting Started
train the model and download it from cnn notebook and don't forget in gui to change the dirctory of the model
